These profiles will be prioritized by Shipsheap when or if the customer is in need of a specific product or service.

the business owner is VERIFIED; if the business owner is NOT verified, Shipsheap will provive an alternative provider of the contact wanted to avoid prolonged contact delays(
or for example, if Shipsheap calls the business and the business does not pick up the phone to confirm availabilty), to not waste the customer's time.
